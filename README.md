If you've come here, you must have seen one of my live-streams that focuses on building this project. If not here are some details.

🔮💻 Astrology & Javascript Series is a project I'm building that uses Remix Framework, React, Typescript & Styled Components but not limited to, to create an educational website on learning the foundational blocks of Astrology. I live-stream my progress and teach some astrology a long the way.
